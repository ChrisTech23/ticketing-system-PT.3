# Ticketing System

## Overview
This is a simple ticketing system built with React for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and DynamoDB for the database. The system allows users to submit tickets for various issues or requests and provides functionality for managing ticket statuses.

## Features
- **Ticket Submission:** Users can fill out a form to submit a new ticket, including a title and description.
- **Form Validation:** Client-side and server-side validation ensure that users provide valid information when submitting tickets.
- **Ticket Display:** Submitted tickets are displayed on the frontend, allowing users to view their details and statuses.
- **Ticket Status Update:** Functionality is provided to update the status of tickets, such as marking them as resolved or closed.

## Components
- **Frontend:** Built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Backend:** Built using Flask, a Python web framework, for handling HTTP requests, processing form submissions, interacting with the database, and rendering HTML templates.
- **Database:** Utilizes DynamoDB to store information about submitted tickets.

## Project Workflow
1. **Backend Setup:** Create the Flask backend with routes for handling ticket submission, status updates, etc. Set up DynamoDB to store ticket information.
2. **Frontend Setup:** Set up the React frontend with components for ticket submission, display, and status update.
3. **API Integration:** Use Axios or another HTTP library to make requests from the frontend to the backend for CRUD operations on tickets.
4. **Component Development:** Create React components for displaying tickets, creating new tickets, updating ticket statuses, etc.
5. **Integration:** Connect the backend and frontend by making API requests from the frontend to the backend for CRUD operations on tickets.
6. **Testing and Debugging:** Thoroughly test the application to ensure all features work as expected. Debug any issues that arise during testing.
7. **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a server or hosting platform so it can be accessed by users.
